====================
Configuration
====================

.. contents::
   :depth: 5

Configuration settings can be passed to the program with the following precedence:

1. Flags passed to the program
2. Environment settings
3. octo.conf
4. ~/octo.conf
5. $ydb_dist/plugin/octo/octo.conf

--------------------
Config files
--------------------

Octo currently looks for a configuration file in the following directories:

* $ydb_dist/plugin/octo/octo.conf
* ~/octo.conf
* ./octo.conf

If the same setting exists in more than one configuration file the setting in the later file (according to the list above) will prevail. An example config file can be found in :code:`$ydb_dist/plugin/octo/octo.conf`.

Sample config file:

.. literalinclude:: ../src/aux/octo.conf.default

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Environment variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following environment variables must be set:

* ydb_dist
* ydb_gbldir
* ydb_routines
* ydb_xc_ydbposix

The environment variables `ydb_dist`, `ydb_gbldir`, and `ydb_routines` can initially be set by sourcing `ydb_env_set` in your YottaDB installation directory.

Example setting of the environment variables (assuming default paths):

 .. parsed-literal::
    source /usr/local/lib/yottadb/r1.28/ydb_env_set
    export ydb_routines=". $ydb_routines"
    export ydb_xc_ydbposix=$ydb_dist/plugin/ydbposix.xc

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Routines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The optional configuration :code:`octo_zroutines` in :code:`octo.conf` can be used to set :code:`$zroutines` (in addition to :code:`$ydb_routines`). :code:`octo_zroutines` will be prepended to :code:`$ydb_routines`.

Octo requires that :code:`$ydb_dist/plugin/o/_ydbocto.so` be in $zroutines, and for at least one valid source directory to exist. The first source directory found in :code:`$zroutines` (after prepending :code:`octo_zroutines` if it is defined in :code:`octo.conf`) will be where generated code is placed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Logging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A config file can include instructions specifying verbosity for logging:

* TRACE: A TRACE message is useful to help identify issues in the code
* INFO: An INFO message is used to relay information to the user
* DEBUG: A DEBUG message helps users debug configuration issues
* WARNING: A WARNING message warns the user about potential problems in the code
* ERROR : An ERROR message informs the user that an error has occurred
* FATAL: A FATAL message terminates the program

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Locations and Global Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All Octo related globals are prefixed with :code:`^%ydbocto`. Using normal global mapping procedures for an existing application global directory (where you want to run Octo), map the global variable namespace :code:`^%ydbocto*` to a separate region (and its associated database file) that meets the below requirements (the below example commands assume the separate region is named :code:`OCTO`).

* :code:`NULL_SUBSCRIPTS` must be set to :code:`ALWAYS`.

  Example: :code:`$ydb_dist/mupip set -null_subscripts=true -region 'OCTO'`

* :code:`KEY_SIZE` must be tuned to your data - this can be set to the maximum allowed by YottaDB - "1019"

   Example: :code:`$ydb_dist/mupip set -key_size=1019 -region 'OCTO'`

* :code:`RECORD_SIZE` must be tuned to your data/queries - a reasonable starting value is "300000"

  Example: :code:`$ydb_dist/mupip set -record_size=300000 -region 'OCTO'`

Some of the globals used in Octo are:

* :code:`^%ydboctoocto`: This global can refer to various functions, variables, octo "read only" table values (postgres mappings, oneRowTable, etc.), and some counts. It needs to persist between sessions.

* :code:`^%ydboctoxref`: This global contains cross-references, row counts and other statistical information. It needs to persist between sessions.

* :code:`^%ydboctoschema`: This global contains information about the tables loaded into the database. It needs to persist between sessions.

Since most of the Octo variables need to persist between sessions, it is necessary that the region(s) mapping the :code:`^%ydbocto*` namespace have replication turned on in a replicated environment (or journaling turned on in a non-replicated environment).

-----------------------
TLS/SSL Configuration
-----------------------

 .. note::
    The instructions provided in this section will help in setting up a :code:`self-signed` certificate for TLS, but *not* for setting up TLS in production.
    Also, a full TLS setup will require certificates signed by a known and trusted certificate authority.

Enabling TLS/SSL requires several additional steps beyond installing the YottaDB encryption plugin - it requires creating a Certificate Authority (CA), generating a TLS/SSL certificate, and making additional changes to :code:`octo.conf`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Generate CA key and certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 .. parsed-literal::

    # In a directory in which you want to store all the certificates for Octo
    # Be sure to create a strong passphrase for the CA
    openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 -out CA.key
    # This creates a CA valid for 1 year and interactively prompts for additional information
    openssl req -new -nodes -key CA.key -days 365 -x509 -out CA.crt

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create server key and certificate request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 .. parsed-literal::

    # This creates a 2048 bit private key
    openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 -out server.key
    # This creates the certificate signing request
    openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sign certificate based on request and local CA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 .. parsed-literal::

    # Asks the CA to sign the certificate with a 1 Year validity time
    openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA CA.crt -CAkey CA.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365
    # Mask the password for the certificate in a way YottaDB understands
    $ydb_dist/plugin/gtmcrypt/maskpass
    # This will need to be added to any startup scripts for octo/rocto
    export ydb_tls_passwd_OCTOSERVER=[Masked Password from maskpass]
    export ydb_crypt_config=/path/to/octo.conf

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Update Octo configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The $ydb_dist/plugin/octo/octo.conf contains an outline of the minimum configuration options needed to enable TLS/SSL. The key items are:

1. In the "rocto" section, "ssl_on" must be set to "true" (no quotes needed in the conf).
2. A "tls" section must be present and generally conform to the requirements specified for the `TLS plugin itself <https://docs.yottadb.com/AdminOpsGuide/tls.html>`_. Other notes:

      * Octo doesn't use any of the "dh*" settings, so those can be omitted.
      * The "format" specifier can also be omitted, as long as the certs are in PEM format.
      * The "CAfile" and "CApath" fields are mandatory and must point to valid files/locations with a full path.
      * A subsection named "OCTOSERVER" with "key", and "cert" settings specifying the names of the private key and cert files.

3. The :code:`ydb_tls_passwd_OCTOSERVER` and :code:`ydb_crypt_config` environment variables must be set correctly.

----------------------------
Usage
----------------------------

Before running Octo/Rocto make sure that the required YottaDB variables are set either by creating your own script or run :code:`source $ydb_dist/ydb_env_set`.

To use the command-line SQL interpreter run: :code:`$ydb_dist/plugin/bin/octo`.

To use the PostgreSQL protocol compatible server run: :code:`$ydb_dist/plugin/bin/rocto`.
