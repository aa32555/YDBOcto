# Start 3 rocto servers in the background by initiating 3 client connections to the same rocto port
# Each client runs the same query in TPC026.sql that takes 12 seconds to complete
# Sleep 5 seconds to give rocto servers time to have started executing queries
# Since they anyways will take 12 seconds to run, we are not losing any test runtime due to this sleep.
# Check YDB locks owned by backgrounded rocto server processes. We expect 3 of them.
# Before YDBOcto#710 fix, we would see only 1 lock at any point in time.
PASS : 3 locks seen in LKE SHOW -ALL output as expected
# Wait for backgrounded clients to finish
# Verify that all 3 queries that ran concurrently gave the correct output
