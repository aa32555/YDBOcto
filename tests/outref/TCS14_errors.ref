-- TCS14 : OCTO544 : Assertion failure and Errors when IN is used in SELECT column list

-- This file contains queries that run fine in Octo but error out or produce different output in Postgres
-- due to false/true being 'f'/'t' in Postgres vs 0/1 in Octo. Hence they cannot be in TCS14.sql (which goes
-- through the crosscheck function and expects Octo and Postgres output to be identical).

-- Below queries used to assert fail due to no column alias defined for a CASE statement column in SELECT column list
SELECT CASE 1 in (1) when 't' then 2 end;
SELECT CASE 1 in (1) when 1 then 2 end;
SELECT CASE 1 in (1) when 3 then 2 end;

-- Below queries worked fine even before the OCTO544 code fixes but are included in case these are not already tested
SELECT CASE 1 = 1 when 0 then 2 end;
SELECT CASE 1 = 1 when 1 then 2 end;
SELECT CASE 1 = 1 when 3 then 2 end;
