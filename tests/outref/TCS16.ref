-- TCS16 : OCTO463 : CASE does not issue a syntax error in WHEN conditions if all code paths lead to the same result

-- The following case cannot be cross-checked against PostgreSQL, since PostgreSQL will
-- issue the following error for these queries:
-- ERROR:  operator does not exist: text = boolean
-- LINE 6:         WHEN ( 'Orechiette' != pastas.pastaname ) THEN NULL
--				   ^
-- HINT:  No operator matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit type casts.

-- However, Octo and MySQL will accept this query and return 0 rows. So test separately
-- by doing outref verification.

-- NULL case, with case_value, omitted ELSE, NULL branches
