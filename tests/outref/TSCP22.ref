-- Following query doesn't work in Postgres isn't parsed properly by Postgres if 'test'='test1' is used within parenthesis then the query works fine. Octo at present is able to parse the following correctly
select FALSE != 'test'='test1';
select FALSE = 'test' = 'test1';

select FALSE != ('test'='test1');
select FALSE = ('test' = 'test1');
