# YDB Octo

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DBMS/YDBOcto/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DBMS/YDBOcto/commits/master)

The YottaDB Octo Database Management System is a SQL access layer built on top of the not-only-SQL database YottaDB.
It aims to provide SQL 92 compliance and exceptional performance.

## Setup

YottaDB r1.28 or greater is required for successful installation of Octo. Installing and configuring YottaDB is described on its own [documentation page](https://docs.yottadb.com/AdminOpsGuide/installydb.html).

*NOTE: the environment variable `$ydb_dist` is required to be defined - `$gtm_dist` is not a valid subsitute*

## Quickstart

### Install prerequisites

#### Install YottaDB POSIX plugin

The YottaDB POSIX plugin can be installed easily by adding the `--posix` option when installing YottaDB with the `ydbinstall` script:

```sh
./ydbinstall --posix
```

Alternatively, users can build the POSIX plugin from source:

```sh
# In a temporary directory perform the following commands
curl -fSsLO https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/Util/YDBPosix/-/archive/master/YDBPosix-master.tar.gz
tar xzf YDBPosix-master.tar.gz
cd YDBPosix-master
mkdir build && cd build
# Make sure that you have YottaDB environment variables in your shell before continuing
cmake ..
make -j `grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo` && sudo make install
```

More detailed instructions are on the [YottaDB POSIX plugin page](https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/Util/YDBPosix/blob/master/README.md).

#### (Optional) Install YottaDB encryption plugin

Installing the YottaDB encryption plugin enables TLS support (Recommended for production installations). You will need to make sure TLS/SSL is enabled for the driver in the client software chosen.

The YottaDB encryption plugin can be installed by adding the `--encplugin` option when installing YottaDB with the `ydbinstall` script:

```sh
./ydbinstall --encplugin
```

Alternatively, users can build the encryption plugin from source:

```sh
# In a temporary directory perform the following commands
sudo tar -xf $ydb_dist/plugin/gtmcrypt/source.tar
# Make sure that you have YottaDB environment variables in your shell before continuing
sudo ydb_dist=$ydb_dist make -j `grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo`
sudo ydb_dist=$ydb_dist make install
```

### Install Octo

Note: there are no binary releases during the beta period

#### From Tarball

1. Decompress the Octo binary package

```sh
tar xzf Octo-*-Linux.tar.gz
```

2. Install Octo

This will install Octo to your `$ydb_dist/plugin` directory.

```sh
cd Octo-*-Linux
./install.sh
```

#### From source

Note: This is the recommended instructions during the beta period as it provides the easiest upgrade path from each commit.

1. Install prerequisite packages

```sh
# Ubuntu Linux OR Raspbian Linux OR Beagleboard Debian
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake bison flex xxd libreadline-dev libconfig-dev libssl-dev

# CentOS Linux OR RedHat Linux
# Note: epel-release has to be installed before cmake3 is installed
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install vim-common cmake3 bison flex readline-devel libconfig-devel openssl-devel
```

2. (Optional) Install Bats Automated Test System (BATS)

Octo uses BATS for automated integration and regression testing. To use BATS to run tests on Octo, BATS version 1.1+ must be installed:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core.git
cd bats-core
sudo ./install.sh /usr
```

This will install BATS to /usr/bin. Note that installing to /usr may require root access or use of `sudo`. To specify an alternative path change the argument to your preferred location, e.g. "/usr/local" to install to /usr/local/bin.

Details available in the [BATS source repo](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core).

3. (Optional) Install cmocka unit testing framework

Octo uses cmocka for automated unit testing. To build and run Octo's unit tests, cmocka must be installed:

```sh
# Ubuntu Linux OR Raspbian Linux OR Beagleboard Debian
sudo apt-get install libcmocka-dev

# CentOS Linux OR RedHat Linux
sudo yum install libcmocka-devel
```

4. (Optional) Install PostgreSQL client (psql)

Octo uses the psql PostgreSQL for some integration/regression tests. To build and run these tests, psql must be installed:

```sh
# Ubuntu Linux OR Raspbian Linux OR Beagleboard Debian
sudo apt-get install postgresql-client

# CentOS Linux OR RedHat Linux
sudo yum install postgresql
```

5. (Optional) Install PostgreSQL server

Octo uses the PostgreSQL server for some integration/regression tests. To build and run these tests, PostgreSQL must be installed:

```sh
# Ubuntu Linux OR Raspbian Linux OR Beagleboard Debian
sudo apt-get install postgresql

# CentOS Linux OR RedHat Linux
sudo yum install postgresql
```

Additionally, PostgreSQL must be set up for the user who will be running the tests:

```sh
sudo -u postgres createuser [username]
sudo -u postgres psql <<PSQL
alter user [username] createdb;
PSQL
```

6. Download Octo Source Code

```sh
# In a temporary directory perform the following commands
curl -fSsLO https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DBMS/YDBOcto/-/archive/master/YDBOcto-master.tar.gz
tar xzf YDBOcto-master.tar.gz
cd YDBOcto-master
```

7. Compile Octo

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
# For VistA the String Buffer Length needs to be larger (described below) add `-DSTRING_BUFFER_LENGTH=300000` to the cmake command below
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$ydb_dist/plugin .. # for CentOS/RedHat use cmake3 instead
make -j `grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo`
```

To generate a Debug build instead of a Release build (the default), add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` to the CMake line above.

To additionally disable the generation of installation rules for `make install`, add `-DDISABLE_INSTALL=ON`. This can be useful when doing testing in a temporary build directory only.

**NOTE**: Octo uses some CMake parameters to control generation of fixed-size buffer allocations. These are:

* `STRING_BUFFER_LENGTH` -- the maximum length of a string within the system; this supersedes any VARCHAR definitions.
* `INIT_M_ROUTINE_LENGTH` -- the initial length for the buffer of generated M routines. The default is 10MB.
* `MEMORY_CHUNK_SIZE` -- size of memory chunks to allocate; default is 32MB.
* `MEMORY_CHUNK_PROTECT` -- if non-zero, memory following chunks is protected to detect buffer overflows. If 2, data is placed closer to the protected region to increase the chances of detecting an error.

Example usage of above parameters:

```sh
cmake -DSTRING_BUFFER_LENGTH=600000 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$ydb_dist/plugin ..
```

8. Install Octo

Install Octo:

```sh
sudo -E make install
```

Redefine environment variables to include newly installed files:

```sh
$ydb_dist/ydb_env_unset
source $(pkg-config --variable=prefix yottadb)/ydb_env_set
```

Note: New Octo installations include a default `octo.conf` configuration file at `$ydb_dist/plugin/octo/octo.conf`, which may be modified post-install. Re-installing Octo will *not* overwrite an existing `octo.conf` in this location, so modifications to this file will be preserved across installations.

### Configure Octo

Octo uses several internal global variables to map a SQL schema/DDL to a YottaDB database: %ydboctoschema, %ydboctoxref, and %ydboctoocto. It is best practice to map these to a separate region that is exclusive to Octo, which requires settings that may conflict with those required by other regions. For more information, refer to the Additional Configuration section below.

Please see the following example for creating a database from scratch with the recommended settings. For more information on setting up a database in YottaDB, refer to the [Administration and Operations Guide](https://docs.yottadb.com/AdminOpsGuide/index.html).

#### Setup Database

```sh
$ cd build
$ export ydb_gbldir=*path to build directory*/octo.gld
$ $ydb_dist/mumps -r GDE
GDE> add -segment OCTO -access_method=bg -file_name=*path to build directory*/octo.dat
GDE> add -region OCTO -dynamic=octo -journal=(before,file="*path to build directory*/octo.mjl") -null_subscripts=always -key_size=1019 -record_size=300000
GDE> add -name %ydboctoschema -region=octo
GDE> add -name %ydboctoxref -region=octo
GDE> add -name %ydboctoocto -region=octo
GDE> verify
GDE> exit
$ mupip create
```

#### Setup environment variables

The following environment variables must be set for Octo to operate properly:

* ydb_dist
* ydb_gbldir
* ydb_routines
* ydb_ci
* ydb_xc_ydbposix

The environment variables `ydb_dist`, `ydb_gbldir`, and `ydb_routines` can initially be set by sourcing `ydb_env_set` in your YottaDB installation directory. Additional modifications to ydb_routines may be needed due to configuration in `octo.conf` described later in this manual.

Example setting of the environment variables (assuming default paths):

```sh
source /usr/local/lib/yottadb/r1.28/ydb_env_set
export ydb_routines="$ydb_dist/plugin/octo/o/_ydbocto.so $ydb_routines"
export ydb_ci=$ydb_dist/plugin/octo/ydbocto.ci
export ydb_xc_ydbposix=$ydb_dist/plugin/ydbposix.xc
```

#### Install PostgreSQL seed data

```sh
$ydb_dist/mupip load $ydb_dist/plugin/octo/postgres-seed.zwr
$ydb_dist/plugin/bin/octo -f $ydb_dist/plugin/octo/postgres-seed.sql
```

## Additional Configuration

Octo currently looks for a configuration file in the following directories:

* $ydb_dist/plugin/octo/octo.conf
* ~/octo.conf
* ./octo.conf

If the same setting exists in more than one configuration file the setting in the later file (according to the list above) will prevail. An example config file can be found in `$ydb_dist/plugin/octo/octo.conf`.

### Routines

Octo requires that `$ydb_dist/plugin/o/_ydbocto.so` and `$ydb_dist/plugin/o/_ydbposix.so` be included in `$ydb_routines`. This is necessary not only for running the `octo` and `rocto` excutables, but also for correctly updating and maintaining the YottaDB triggers that are used to maintain cross references for Octo. Accordingly, these paths should be added to `$ydb_routines` in your normal environment setup scripts.

### Globals

All octo related globals are prefixed with `^%ydbocto`. Using normal global mapping procedures for an existing application global directory (where you want to run Octo), map the global variable namespace `^%ydbocto*` to a separate region (and its associated database file) that meets the below requirements (the below example commands assume the separate region is named `OCTO`).

* `NULL_SUBSCRIPTS` must be set to `ALWAYS`.
  * Example: `$ydb_dist/mupip set -null_subscripts=true -region 'OCTO'`
* `KEY_SIZE` must be tuned to your data - this can be set to the maximum allowed by YottaDB - `1019`.
  * Example: `$ydb_dist/mupip set -key_size=1019 -region 'OCTO'`
* `RECORD_SIZE` must be tuned to your data/queries - a reasonable starting value is `300000`.
  * Example: `$ydb_dist/mupip set -record_size=300000 -region 'OCTO'`

### TLS/SSL Configuration

Enabling TLS/SSL requires several additional steps beyond installing the YottaDB encryption plugin - it requires creating a Certificate Authority (CA), generating a TLS/SSL certificate, and making additional changes to `octo.conf`

#### Generate CA key and certificate

```sh
# In a directory in which you want to store all of the certificates for Octo
# Be sure to create a good passphrase for the CA
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 -out CA.key
# This creates a CA valid for 1 Year and interactively prompts for additional information
openssl req -new -nodes -key CA.key -days 365 -x509 -out CA.crt
```

#### Create server key and certificate request

```sh
# This creates a 2048 bit private key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 -out server.key
# This creeates the certificate signing request
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
```

#### Sign certificate based on request and local CA

```sh
# Asks the CA to sign the certificate with a 1 Year validity time
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA CA.crt -CAkey CA.key -CAcreateserial \
        -out server.crt -days 365
# Mask the password for the certificate in a way YottaDB understands
$ydb_dist/plugin/gtmcrypt/maskpass
# This will need to be added to any startup scripts for octo/rocto
export ydb_tls_passwd_OCTOSERVER=[Masked Password from maskpass]
export ydb_crypt_config=/path/to/octo.conf
```

#### Update Octo configuration file

The $ydb_dist/plugin/octo/octo.conf contains an outline of the minimum configuration options needed to enable TLS/SSL. The key items are:

1. In the "rocto" section, "ssl_on" must be set to "true" (no quotes needed in the conf).
2. A "tls" section must be present and generally conform to the requirements specified for the [TLS plugin itself](https://docs.yottadb.com/AdminOpsGuide/tls.html). Other notes:
      * Octo doesn't use any of the "dh*" settings, so those can be omitted.
      * The "format" specifier can also be omitted, as long as the certs are in PEM format.
      * The "CAfile" and "CApath" fields are mandatory and must point to valid files/locations with a full path.
      * A subsection named "OCTOSERVER" with "key", and "cert" settings specifying the names of the private key and cert files.
3. The ydb_tls_passwd_OCTOSERVER and ydb_crypt_config environment variables must be set correctly.

## Usage

Before running Octo/Rocto make sure that the required YottaDB variables are set either by creating your own script or run `source $ydb_dist/ydb_env_set`.

To use the command-line SQL interpreter run: `$ydb_dist/plugin/bin/octo`.
To use the PostgreSQL protocol compatible server run: `$ydb_dist/plugin/bin/rocto`.

### Docker container

A docker container is available in this repository and on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/yottadb/octo). This docker container automatically starts `rocto`. The container is built with the following assumptions:

* The `ydb_env_set` script is used to setup the YottaDB environment and creates/expects a specific layout for globals and routines, specifically:
  * a `r1.28_x86_64` directory with the following sub directories:
    * `g` directory which contains at a minimum:
    * `yottadb.gld` global directory
    * `o` directory which contains the compiled M code
    * `r` directory which contains the source M code
  * a `r` directory which contains the source M code
* The octo default configuration is used in `/opt/yottadb/current/plugin/octo/octo.conf`

### Starting the docker container

The `docker run` command should be run in the directory where the above directory structure is defined as it is mounted as a volume within the docker container.

```sh
docker run -it -v `pwd`:/data -p 1337:1337 yottadb/octo:latest-master
```

This will then display the rocto log file on stdout. If you'd prefer to run the container as a daemon use the `-d` command line parameter to run the container as a daemon. For example:

```sh
docker run -itd -v `pwd`:/data -p 1337:1337 yottadb/octo:latest-master
```

The logs can then be retrieved using the `docker logs` command with the container name or ID as an argument.

### Getting access to the container

#### PostgreSQL wire protocol

The rocto server is listening on port 1337 and all of the directions in the above documentation apply.

#### Command-line access

You can use the `docker exec` command to get access to the container for more troubleshooting. Example:

```sh
docker exec -it {nameOfContainer/IDOfContainer} /bin/bash
```
